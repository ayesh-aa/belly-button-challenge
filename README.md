## Project Description

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is a web application that provides an interactive way to explore the microbial species found in human belly buttons. The data visualizations include:

- A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in each sample.
- A bubble chart displaying the relative frequency of all OTUs in each sample.
- Demographic information for each test subject.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Belly Button Biodiversity study](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json), which catalogs the bacteria found in the navels of various individuals.

## Features

- Dropdown menu to select different test subjects.
- Horizontal bar chart of the top 10 OTUs for the selected subject.
- Bubble chart showing the frequency of OTUs for the selected subject.
